Day 1, Part 2 = Chronal Calibration

You notice that the device repeats the same frequency change list over and over. To calibrate the device, you need to find the first frequency it reaches twice. Repeating list many times may be necessary.

Examples:
+1, -1 first reaches 0 twice
+3, +3, +4, -2, -4 first reaches 10 twice
